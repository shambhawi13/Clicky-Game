# Clicky-Game
Its a memory game with React. The application dynamically reads all images from Assets folder and displays as card. On click of each image, score will be calculated. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.


```
Here is how the application works:
```
